        The PSC house is what you make of it, you can engage and meet with
        like-minded individuals. The Club house will begin as a Discord channel
        at first, where members can interact. But members have the power to make
        the Passengers clubhouse something more through clubhouse road map
        activation.

      <p className="text-passengerWhite font-normal mt-5 text-center lg:text-left text-[0.85rem]">
        Through the clubhouse roadmap activation, the clubhouse can play a part
        in the meta-verse (the island state)as a digital home for passengers
        alter self. with many restricted rooms and halls at first, but members
        can unlock them overtime through membership point. Should the clubhouse
        mysteriously teleport to a familiar city, it will be for members to
        rendezvous and experience what a nightlife was like in the train city.
