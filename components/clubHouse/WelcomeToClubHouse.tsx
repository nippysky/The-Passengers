        In the Passengers Club House you can engage and meet with like-minded
        individuals and storytelling. The PSC House will begin as a Discord
        channel at first, where members can interact. But members have the power
        to make the Passengers clubhouse something more through clubhouse road
        map activation.

        The clubhouse can play a part in the meta-verse (the island state) with
        many restricted rooms and halls at first, but members can unlock them
        overtime through membership point. Should the clubhouse mysteriously
        teleport to a familiar city, it will be for members to rendezvous and
        experience what a nightlife was like in the train city.
