        The clubhouse serves as a remote commute for geniuses from all over the
        world and provides opportunities for all members to meet like-minded
        individuals, create, collaborate, and enjoy benefits. So many are gifted
        yet isolated, and with no one to foster an understanding of their
        genius, humans often surpass limitations through collective effort.
        Genius is Rare, Transcend. The Clubhouse will begin as a Discord channel
        at first, where members can interact. But members have the power to make
        the Passengers Clubhouse something more through clubhouse road map
        activation.

        Through the clubhouse roadmap activation, the clubhouse can play a part
        in the meta-verse (the island state)as a digital home for passengers
        alter self. with many restricted rooms and halls at first, but members
        can unlock them overtime through membership point. Should the clubhouse
        mysteriously teleport to a familiar city, it will be for members to
        rendezvous and experience what a nightlife was like in the train city.
